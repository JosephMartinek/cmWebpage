		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			I am a local dance instructor certified in Anne Green Gilbert’s 
			acclaimed creative dance method looking to bring dance into your 
			classroom! The arts, specifically movement and dance, have been 
			scientifically proven to benefit children’s learning as well as 
			their balance, coordination, creativity and self-confidence. As 
			someone with a passion for both dance and early childhood education, 
			I can attest that through my personal experience with the program 
			just how wonderful it is for children’s growing bodies and minds.
		</p>
		<p>
			I structure my classes into five essential components. The first
			component is a warm-up, the “Brain Dance”. This is a special set 
			of movements focuses on the body’s natural reflexes and wiring of
			the brain; it not only warms up the body, but exercises the mind 
			and improves children’s ability to make neuro-connections. The 
			second part of the class is the exploration of the monthly concept,
			such as how to move through space, parts of the body, musicality and 
			rhythm, and shape. Third is the developing skills component, involving
			activities to strengthen children’s coordination, balance, and 
			self-control. Fourth is the creating activity of the day, which 
			allows children the ability to explore self-expression and self-discovery.
			This could include free-dancing involving the introduced concept, 
			an obstacle course, playing with a parachute, dancing along to a 
			movement story, or doing a folk dance. Lastly is a cool-down,
			involving reflection and relaxing the body.
		</p>
		<p>
			I can provide:
			<ul>
				<li>30 minute or 45 minute lessons</li>
				<li>My own props</li>
				<li>My own music</li>
				<li>Plenty of variety to keep it fun and interesting!</li>
			</ul>
